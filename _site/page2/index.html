    <div class="post-entry">
    <p><img src="http://imgur.com/9pCXqKb.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A few days I added a <a href="https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/">Kinesis</a> Countoured Model 110 to my collection. The predecessor to the Advantage and the Advantage 2, this model is over 20 years old.</p>

<p>I got the board for a steal on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket">/r/mechmarket</a>. The seller said the board was not functional, producing only a beeping tone when plugged in. I figured that if all else, even if the built-in electronics weren’t functional that I could hand wire a matrix for it. Much to my surprise, using my PS/2 to USB adapter, the board is fully functional.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/Ji4qdVn.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Kinesis is notable for its split design and ergonomic keywells.</p>

<p><a href="http://missourivalleyambulance.com/ErgoDox_Omnibus">ErgoDox</a> derives much of its design from the Kinesis. Given that I’ve been using an ErgoDox as my daily driver at work for some time, using the Kinesis (albiet briefly) has proven fairly easy.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/eScRdV0.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>From the side you can see the sculpting of the keywells. At first glance the sculpting appears haphazard, but in using it, the sculpting has proven to be brilliant. Clearly a lot of time and effort went into this design by the Kinesis engineers.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/Cp1dn8M.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Standard for Kinesis boards of the time, this one has plate mount <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX_Brown">Cherry MX browns</a>. I’ve never actually had a full board with browns before. They have a decent tactile bump, at 45g they’re light, but not too light. I did notice that they are quite scratchy, a common complaint about Cherry browns.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/Q1G1waG.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As I said, the board is over 20 years old. Tag dates it to circa 1993.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/jqEzns5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The I/O includes a PS/2 port for connecting to your PC, and 2 RJ-11 jacks used with optional foot switches.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/o5IbEyE.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Cracking the board open, you can see how nuts the internal electronics are. By my count there are 7 PCBs inside, including the control electronics.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/GQhuySV.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Each keywell has this separated PCB design, terminating in a ribbon cable connected to the ‘main’ PCB.</p>

<p>Each side of the board also has 9 rubber membrane keys. These also terminate in a ribbon cable also connected to the main PCB.</p>

<p>The main PCB contains the keys for the thumb cluster. Each keywell PCB connects to it. The control electronics connect to this board.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/AxiPTsd.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The main control electronics are pretty crazy. With jumper cables on several of the circuits. Not sure if this is due to errors during design, or if the jumpers are intentional.</p>

<p>Of course, I can’t leave well alone, so I have modifications planned for this board.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Swap in Gateron switches.
    <ul>
      <li>I am thinking I’ll put in Gateron Browns, but I have a few different switches on order, so I may find myself installing Gatistotles or Zealios instead.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Replace control electronics.
    <ul>
      <li>Given that the board is fully functional in its current state, I’d like to keep most of the existing PCBs in place. I’m hoping that I can sort out the pin configuration for the the keywell &amp; membrane PCBs and wire them to a Teensy microcontroller, granting me modern USB connectivity, and full programability using TMK/QMK.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Keycaps
    <ul>
      <li>The stock sculpted DCS profile keycaps are great, but I may want to swap in all DSA profile or SA profile keys. I haven’t decided yet.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <div class="post-entry">
    <h3 id="some-background">Some Background</h3>

<p>For two years now I’ve been managing my own email server built on <a href="https://mailinabox.email/">Mailinabox</a>. I first built out the box in the wake of the Snowden revelations. It occurred to me that while Gmail does offer state-of-the-art encryption on their data at rest, it was entirely possible that Google would be subject to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter">NSLs</a> and definitely even mass data collection.</p>

<p>Of course, email never really was designed for security, and unless you’re using PGP on every message it’s possible for <strong>anyone</strong> listening on the wire to intercept messages as they come and go. Despite this, I felt it was best to decentralize myself - and thus remove as much of my digital identity from Google as possible.</p>

<p>If one’s threat model is a nation state actor there is no perfect defense against that, but it is possible to minimize the attack surface or at least make it a bit more difficult to be attacked or surveilled by being removed from as many centralized systems as possible. Thus, Mailinabox.</p>

<h3 id="the-first-cracks-appear">The First Cracks Appear</h3>

<p>Everything was working perfectly until a few months ago - the build of my box predated Mailinbox’s <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">LetsEncrypt</a> integration, so I used an SSL cert issued by Comodo, and later WoSign. It was time to get myself moved off those options and on to LetsEncrypt (and in the wake of news of misdeeds by both Comodo and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2016/10/24/distrusting-new-wosign-and-startcom-certificates/">WoSign</a> that was a good decision), however my box was being stubborn. Even if I SFTP’d into the machine and removed the existing certs, I couldn’t get any new certs to apply.</p>

<p>Digging around the <a href="https://discourse.mailinabox.email/">Mailinabox support forums</a>, I found the proper script to invoke:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>./management/ssl_certificates.py --force
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>After that the LetsEncrypt cert was successfully applied, but weird stuff started happening to the server. Where once the status pages would show me all was well, I started getting failures instead. Despite the Status Checks page failing, the box was fully functional.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I let the box continue to run until today - when it finally broke on me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once a LetsEncrypt certificate is issued, Mailinabox is <em>supposed</em> to automatically renew the cert every 90 days. Today, my original LetsEncrypt cert expired. First warning was my phone telling me over and over again that it couldn’t connect to the mail server.</p>

<h3 id="everything-is-on-fire">Everything Is On Fire</h3>

<p>I was unable to get new emails on my phone, and my desktop machine was making similar complaints.</p>

<p>First step was to go out to the box’s admin page in an attempt to issue a new cert from the TLS console. In the interest of security, Mailinabox deployments enforce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HTTP Strict Transport Security</a> (HSTS), which enforces SSL after you visit an encrypted site for the first time. HSTS is there to prevent a user from being exposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downgrade_attack">downgrade attacks</a>. In this case, with an expired certificate it prevented me from initiating a web connection with the site at all.</p>

<p>Next step was to SSH into the server and attempt the ssl_certificates.py script again - foiled! I got an error and it wouldn’t run. The server was telling me it had issues with OpenSSL - this was likely the result of my messing around with the server months earlier trying to force it to get a LetsEncrypt manually.</p>

<p>I <em>hoped</em> that an update would fix it, but unfortunately it did not. Just attempting to run the update to Mailinabox v0.21C didn’t work. Again I was encountering errors regarging OpenSSL.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time to build a new box</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point I figured the only resolution was to build out a new box and attempt to migrate/recover all my data. Fortunately there is a guide on how to do that <a href="https://mailinabox.email/maintenance.html#moving-boxes">here.</a></p>

<p>First I ran a manual backup.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd mailinabox
sudo management/backup.py
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>By default Mailinabox does daily backups, but it was best to have a totally up-to-date backup. I also went into Mail, Contacts, and Calendar on my local machine and exported everything I had, just in case I was unable to restore from the backup on to the new box.</p>

<p>Then it was time to get the backup off the machine, so I fired up FileZilla and SFTP’d into the box. Per the Mailinabox instructions it’s neccessary to only grab <em>/home/user-data/backup/secret_key.txt</em> and <em>/home/user-data/backup/encrypted</em>, but I opted to backup the entire <em>/user-data/</em> folder.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/td2P77x.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I then got started spinning up a new server with <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>. It was necessary to rename my old droplet to <em>box.missourivalleyambulance.com</em> to <em>box.missourivalleyambulance.com.old</em>. I was able to get the new box up and running quickly, including the Mailinabox install. The setup for this is actually down to a single curl command.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl -s https://mailinabox.email/setup.sh | sudo bash
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>After the box was set up and fully configured, I went over to GoDaddy to set up the new IP address. One thing that’s brilliant about Mailinabox is that it hosts its DNS - so the only thing needed on the registrar’s end are the nameserver addresses.</p>

<p>Then it was time to SFTP into the new box, upload the <em>/user-data/backup/encrypted/</em> folder, rename the existing <em>/user-data/</em> folder to <em>/user-data-old/</em> and run the restore command.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd mailinabox/home
export PASSPHRASE=$(cat secret_key.txt)
sudo -E duplicity restore file:///home/backups/encrypted /home/user-data/
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>A quick server reboot, and the box was back to its original configuration.</p>

<h3 id="the-fire-extinguished">The Fire Extinguished</h3>

<p>The timing for this failure was quite good actually. My domain was up for renewal with GoDaddy, expiring on 2/10. Since I was doing all this work with rebuilding the server today, I took the time go get my domain transferred over to <a href="https://www.hover.com/">Hover.</a> I’m just a few hours into being a Hover customer, but so far I’m pretty impressed. Their site offers step-by-step guides for how to get a domain released from GoDaddy and prepped for transfer to Hover. From the time I initiated the transfer until it was complete was just under an hour. Hover even automatically copied over all the nameserver glue records, so there was no fighting with those trying to get DNS working correctly with the mailserver.</p>

<p>It’s funny - when I first got this mail server up and running 2 years ago it took me ages to get everything configured correctly. The whole process took me weeks. The largest barrier was getting the old Comodo SSL cert &amp; DNS up and running correctly as I had no idea what I was doing. Today I experienced an unexpected failure of my mailserver, requiring a total rebuild. I was able to get it all resolved within a few hours. The largest parts of the rebuild today was just waiting for all <em>/user-data/</em> directory information to transfer from one server to another, and waiting for DNS records to propagate after moving the server to a new IP address.</p>

  <p>The new Touch Bar is often marketed as a gimmick, but one powerful capability it has is to function as a lockdown mechanism for your machine in the event of a physical breach. By changing a few power management settings and customizing the Touch Bar, you can add a button that will instantly lock the machine’s screen and then begin a countdown (that’s configurable, e.g. 5 minutes) to lock down the entire system, which will disable the fingerprint reader, remove power to the RAM, and discard your FileVault keys, effectively locking the encryption, protecting you from cold boot attacks, and prevent the system from being unlocked by a fingerprint.</p>

    <p>Following up on a <a href="/2016-12-10-Peeqo-The-GIF-Bot">post</a> from last month, the creator of <a href="http://peeqo.com/">Peeqo</a> has created a video about his GIF bot.</p>

<p>Now, more than before I realize the potential of this bot. Peeqo just <strong>exudes</strong> charm.</p>

<p>The GIF response functionality is just a red herring to me. I see a bot like this, and I see personality, I see true potential for digital assistants. Systems like Siri and Echo make use of natural language understanding and machine learning, but they don’t have a lot of personality.</p>

<p>I see great potential with Peeqo (or a similar bot) serving for the front end of an Echo or a Siri-like machine learning system. It’s fantastic. The developer plans to make the entire project open source, so there is a real possibility of seeing something like this available (even if it’s DIY) soon.</p>

<p>I want one.</p>

    <div class="post-entry">
    <p>Intel’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaby_Lake">Kaby Lake</a> CPUs were <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/10959/intel-launches-7th-generation-kaby-lake-i7-7700k-i5-7600k-i3-7350k">‘officially’</a> launched today. Kaby Lake is a marked change from Intel’s old Tick/Tock release schedule. They are instead moving to <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/10183/intels-tick-tock-seemingly-dead-becomes-process-architecture-optimization">Process/Architecture/Optimization.</a> This ‘optimization’ release looks to offer few improvements over the 6th generation Skylake chips:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like the Devil’s Canyon refresh of Haswell, Kaby Lake desktop is but a mere clock speed boost disguised under the nomenclature of a new CPU generation. From an IPC standpoint, there’s nothing to tell Kaby Lake apart from Skylake. The one feature that might have proved interesting—support for Optane memory—is unlikely to be put to use until late 2017.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a Mac user, I mostly ignore Intel’s high-end CPU SKUs. That said, when happens in the high end can also have implications for their mobile chips. If Intel can’t iterate on their chips, Apple can’t ship machines with updated hardware.</p>

<p>Curiously, it’s worth noting that while the U series chips (like those used in the MacBook Air) are present in the Kaby Lake lineup, the only Y chip (used in the 12” Macbook) is an m3. Given this, I’m curious if the 12” Macbook will be updated any time soon.</p>
