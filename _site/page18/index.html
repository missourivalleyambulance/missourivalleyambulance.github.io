    <p><img src="http://imgur.com/nz82WaC.jpg" alt="Wall⋅E before assembly" /></p>

<p>For Christmas this year I was fortunate enough to receive a Lego Wall ⋅ E from my mother.</p>

<p>Side note: don’t bother using Amazon’s gift wrapping service, they include a packing slip that spoils the whole thing - that’s why I opened it early.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/GZRhkYk.jpg" alt="Beginning Assembly" /></p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/VnpArvQ.jpg" alt="Body taking shape" /></p>

<p>Wall ⋅ E is the first complex/advanced Lego set I’ve built in probably a decade. Like many kids, I was nuts for Lego as a child, I’d spend hours and hours endlessly building and rebuilding things out if my giant container of parts (which I still have by the way).</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/2IrYV7A.jpg" alt="Building Treads" /></p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/ktGeZrJ.jpg" alt="Body complete" /></p>

<p>As an adult, I still have an appreciation for Lego, but up until recently I’ve never had somewhere to display any sets I might have. Funny how things change as one ages. As a child, what a set was meant to be proved pretty irrelevant - it might exist as something that followed the instructions for a day or too, but it was soon dismantled. Now as an adult, any sets I might find myself wanting will be bought solely to be built and displayed as the instructions intended.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/Bq1efPR.jpg" alt="Body with eyes complete" /></p>

<p>I was so pleased to have gotten Wall ⋅E  as a gift. I adore the character, and sitting down for a few hours to build a Lego set for the first time in a <strong>long</strong> time was very rewarding. I think this will inspire me to finally purchase and build some of the sets I’ve been pining after for a while.</p>

    <div class="post-entry">
    <p>The world of <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series">Alps keyboard switches(SKCL/SKCM)</a> is complex and deep. Modern day keyboards typically use <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX">Cherry MX</a> based switches, but in the personal computer boom of the 1980s, Alps was a dominant force.</p>

<p>Many many keyboards in the 80s made use of Alps switches, notably: Apple’s Extended Keyboard <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard">I</a> &amp; <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard_II">II</a>, and Dell’s <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Dell_AT101">AT101</a> (and variants). As stated in a previous <a href="/posts/2015-12-12-2-On-Becoming-A-Keyboard-Wonk.md">blog post</a>, my first real introduction to mechanical keyboards was by way of Alps switches - so naturally given that they are my first love, they are my favorite switch type.</p>

<p>Alps ceased to make mechanical keyboard switches in the late 90s, unable to survive against the Cherry MX, which has today become the defacto switch type. There are modern-day clones of Alps’ design, but I (and many other keyboard wonks like me) prefer the vintage switches.</p>

<p>Unlike Cherry, which has a <em>fairly</em> limited selection of switches, Alps’ was very wide - with both linear, tactile, and clicky variants, in slider colors such as <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCM_White">white</a>, <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCM_Cream_Damped">cream</a>, <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCL_Yellow">yellow</a>, <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCM_Brown">brown</a>, <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCM_Black">black</a>, <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCM_Orange">orange</a>, <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCL_Grey">grey</a>, <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCM_Amber">‘taxi’ yellow</a>, <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCM_Salmon">salmon</a>, <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCL_Green">green</a>, and a couple more.</p>

<p>Like all things keyboard related, the type of switch you prefer is up to personal preference. The common switches that most folks have fairly early access to are: black, cream, salmon, and white. There is a general consensus among buyers that cream often feels like rubber domes, black tends to be quite scratchy, and salmon and white are pretty decent.</p>

<p>Despite being out of production for ~15 years, its fairly trivial to pick up an Alps board. A cursory ebay search for alps keyboards will turn up a couple hundred results, often with boards filled with the above common switches.</p>

<p>Having tried a few common variants (white, white damped, cream, and orange), I was very happy with my Alps boards. There is however, a fairly rare, and VERY highly desired switch: the <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCM_Blue">blue</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/B12gUH7.jpg" alt="Blue Alps Switch" /><br />
<a href="http://sandy55.fc2web.com/keyboard/acer_kb101a.html">source</a></p>

<p>Blue Alps are generally regarded by the community as being the ultimate switch. They are tactile, smooth, and clicky. On paper, they are nearly identical to white.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/wA1uIV2.jpg" alt="Comparison of white and blue SKCM switches" /><br />
<a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/File:Alps_SKCMAF_and_SKCMAG_specifications.jpg">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>nearly identical</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few months ago, when I had the opportunity to join a <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=75491.0">group buy</a> that would be producing another round of modern 60% Alps compatible pcbs, I knew that if I were to join and build another Alps board, I HAD to have blues. I had to get a donor board to extract those sweet sweet blue switches from.</p>

<p>Trouble is, unlike switches that are common across many types of boards (white), or switches that were in boards with very high production rates (black, Dell AT101), the blue is rare. It is confirmed to be present in about a dozen makes of boards, but even then, blues are only on <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCM_Blue#Keyboards"><em>some</em></a> of those models. There is really only one board that is available ‘regularly’ that is confirmed to have been produced with <strong>ONLY</strong> blues: the <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Leading_Edge_DC-2014">Leading Edge DC-2014</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been on the hunt for a blue alps board for about 6 months now. Because of their rarity and desirability, they go for a premium, and when they do show up, they go <strong>quickly</strong>. Typical switches are $0.30-0.60 each, blues command $1+. In 6 months of searching, I’ve come across fewer than a half dozen blue alps boards - often I found them just shortly after they were sold. On one occasion, I did come across a board that appeared to have gone unnoticed on eBay, but with fewer than 10 seconds left on the auction, I was outbid by a mere $2.</p>

<p>Much to my amazement, last week I came across someone who didn’t know what they had. For months I’ve had saved searches on ebay for terms like “DC-2014”, “leading edge keyboard”, “blue alps”, and the like - but I adventurous last week; I did a generic search for <em>“Leading Edge”</em> and came across someone selling a Leading Edge computer <em>with keyboard</em>. The listing didn’t say what model the board was, but I was counting on my visual identification skills that it WAS a DC-2014. Fortuantely, the auction had a buy-it-now option, and I’d soon purchased it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s right, I did a buy-it-now on a listing for a computer that <em>happens to come with a keyboard</em> for the sole purpose of getting a keyboard that <em>might</em> be the one I’m after.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was very pleased when a few short days later, a big box with a tower and keyboard arrived, and my educated guess was RIGHT! It was a board with blue alps! It IS a Leading Edge DC-2014!</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/dDQEHea.jpg" alt="Leading Edge DC-2014" /></p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/yMjL8AB.jpg" alt="Leading Edge DC-2014" /></p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/int4rR7.jpg" alt="Leading Edge DC-2014" /></p>

<p>For reference, this keyboard is from circa 1988, so it’s no surprise that it looks a bit dirty, and a bit rough. Keep in mind, this uses XT for input, so it is no way compatible with modern computers. The layout is really quite novel, but given that there’s no real hope (without a <em>ton</em> of work) of getting it working with a modern computer, I don’t feel too terrible for what I will do soon: gut it and desolder all the switches.</p>

<p>The switches themselves confirm everything that I’d heard online about blues. They are quite similar to whites, specifically they’re very similar to the <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCM_White_Damped">white damped</a> switches in my AEKII at work, but there are subtle differences. They feel slightly lighter, slightly smoother, the click is sligtly deeper. It’s not a GIANT difference, but for me, it’s noticable. They’re fantastic - definitely the best alps switches I’ve used.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/EcxeBD5.jpg" alt="Dirty Blue Alps switches in a Leading Edge DC-2014" /></p>

<p>Given the age and general dirtiness of the board and switches, after they’re desoldered they’ll need a bit of refurbishment. I’ll need to disassemble each switch, clean out any dust, and relubricate them. I fully expect that after they’re mounted in their new modern PCB, and fully refurbished, they will become my new favorite switch, and that board will even have a decent chance of becoming my new primary board.</p>

<p>It might seem silly, but after searching for such a rare switch for months and months, and FINALLY having in my hands what I’ve been searching for, it’s a great feeling.</p>

<p>There exists within the keyboard community the idea of an “endgame keyboard”: the board so absolutely perfect that you will cease to buy keyboards, and will have reached your endgame. Based on my first impressions of these switches, and how fond of them I am already, one might think that whatever board these end up in might end up being my endgame board; this would be a mistake, there is no endgame keyboard, the chase and the quest will always continue.</p>

    <div class="post-entry">
    <p>I’ve just finished watching the first episode of SyFy’s new highly-anticipated series: <a href="http://www.syfy.com/theexpanse">The Expanse</a>.</p>

<p>I’m not familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series)">novel series</a>, but I was looking forward to watching the show after all the hype I heard about it from <a href="https://twitter.com/sggrc">Steve Gibson</a> on <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/security-now">Security Now</a>. By all accounts, The Expanse looks to be SyFy’s first truly serious, high production value series since Battlestar Galactica. For someone like me who doesn’t have paid cable television, it’s not too often that I’m aware of new shows weeks before they premiere. I’d even seen previews for the show during the trailers before a few movies - so I was excited for it to begin.</p>

<p>I’ve only watched the <a href="http://www.syfy.com/theexpanse/videos/101-dulcinea">first episode</a> so far, but I’m excited for where this series is headed. We establish that it takes place ~300 years in to the future. Mars and Earth are both populated by humans, but operate as completely separately governed planets, and another population of humans exists in deep space, and in the asteroid belt, mining them for precious resources - namely, water.</p>

<p>In the first episode, we establish ourselves with a <a href="http://www.syfy.com/theexpanse/cast/chrisjen-avasarala/1">stern politician</a> on Earth, a brooding noir-like <a href="http://www.syfy.com/theexpanse/cast/joe-miller/1">detective</a> on an asteroid base, and a <a href="http://www.syfy.com/theexpanse/cast/jim-holden/1">young XO</a> on a mining ship. Thus far, I find the interrogator on Earth, and the XO on the mining ship to be the most intriguing characters, but I’m hopeful that the cliched brooding detective character will have a payoff in the future episodes.</p>

<p>The world in the Expanse is certainly captivating. Many of the problems that exist in modern-day Earth seem to have continued into the future as well. The Expanse is not a bright shiny utopia, there is struggle, there is a certainly poverty among the people working in the asteroid belt. Mind you, it’s not entirely dark and gritty, but there is a definite sense of realism that the classes of people that exist today will have an analogue in the future as well.</p>

<p>Thus far in the first 44 minutes of the shows, we’re left with far more questions that we’ve had answered - and I like that. It makes me curious for where the show is going. We’re left with questions as to why the colonies on Earth and the Mars are unified, but why the government of Mars seems to be at the brink of war with Earth. We’re told very little about Mars, actually; we meet no characters on Mars, so we wonder what’s Mars’ deal. We hear murmurs about a terrorist organization led by people from the asteroid belt - but is it a simple fight for equality, or something more? The biggest question we’re left with comes at the end of the show when the XO and his mining ship crew find a big surprise for themselves. I won’t spoil it, but it takes us in a great direction.</p>

<p>So far, it looks to be great Science Fiction. The Expanse shows us an intriguing world with interesting characters, a plausible future for humanity, great acting, and great production value(I mention this because lets be honest, often SyFy feels cheap).</p>

<p>Based on what I’ve seen so far, this doesn’t look like it’s going to be like BSG, which was very much <em>The West Wing in space</em>, but we’re off to a promising start.</p>

<p>The first <a href="http://www.syfy.com/theexpanse/episodes">4 episodes</a> are now available for streaming on SyFy’s website.</p>
