Really rad keycap set from The Van Keyboards. This set was already used as an optional addon for the [Minivan keyboard](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/minivan-keyboard?mode=guest_open) when it dropped on Massdrop. Now a full LightCycle keycap set is being offered.

The set is DSA profile, manufactured by Signature Plastics. What's quite notable about this set is the inclusion of Alps mount as an option. This is one of the very very few custom Alps keycap sets that's been produced. The only other full set I'm aware of is Njbair's [Alpine Winter](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=75515.0), which I used on my [Blue Alps](http://missourivalleyambulance.com/2016-04-04-Blue-Alps-Build-Log) board. Even more rad than even _basic_ Alps layout support (Alpine Winter only supported 60%) is the compatibility set.

The compatibility set expands the supported layouts significantly - including ErgoDox, Planck, and Clueboard.

I'm very excited for the possibilities for this set. I'm not sure what I'd build with it, but I ordered the base + compatibility for Alps mount switches. I've got plenty of SKCL Green and SKCM Brown switches on hand, so I figure I'll use one (or both) of those for a board with these keycaps.
