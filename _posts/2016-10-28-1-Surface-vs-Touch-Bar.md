[SixColors - Perpendicular Philosophy](https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/10/perpendicular-philosophy/)

> Microsoft believes that traditional computer interfaces and modern mobile-device touchscreen interfaces should be melded together, blurring the lines between tablet and PC. This week’s introduction of the Surface Studio—think of an iMac that can be folded down onto your desk and used as a gigantic iPad—is perhaps the most impressive iteration of that belief to date.
<br><br>
> Apple, in contrast, believes that touchscreen interfaces are great and computers are great and they’re not the same thing. Apple has steadfastly resisted adding touchscreens to the Mac, and when you ask the company’s executives why, they have been remarkably consistent on this point for the past few years.
What defines a computer, they’ll say, is that it’s made up of two perpendicular surfaces. 
<br><br>
> There’s a vertical display surface, more or less up and down, right in front of you. And there’s a horizontal control surface—a table or desk or the base of a laptop—that you use for input and control. If you want a Mac, that’s what you get. If you want a touch-based device, get an iPad.

I got the opportunity to play with a Surface Studio at a Microsoft Store yesterday - the machine is absolutely incredible. **_Incredible!_**

[Surface Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-studio) brings a true [drafting table](http://furbo.org/2007/07/16/multi-touch-on-the-desktop/) model to consumers. My employer is doing a refresh for our artists soon, I've already asked that we get at least one for experimentation. I think it will prove popular. 

I'm excited to try the [MacBook Pro with Touch Bar](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/). It's a marked difference in computing perspective from Microsoft. Apple has created a technology that will prove valuable for both creative professionals and regular consumers. 

It's great to see both innovations from both companies. 

One small thought though: [$1799](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro) for the base MacBook Pro with Touch Bar hurts. For the average Apple consumer that's still spendy.
