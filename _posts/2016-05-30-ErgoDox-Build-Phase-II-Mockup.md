When I began planning my Ergodox build, I had my eyes on a build by [witbliz](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=42772.msg1934474#msg1934474) using aluminum plates from [AKmalamute](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=55651.0)'s group buy.

A week ago a full-hand set from that buy popped up on r/mechmarket, so I had to have it.

I've now assembled a mockup - plates, switches, and keycaps (Granite) of Ergodox with this.

Conclusions:

+ Metal is definitely the _wrong_ material for this build, carbon fiber is definitely looking the better material.

+ The separated plate design looks amazing. I'd like to do away with the 5th plate, but this looks killer.

+ Full-hand is the way to go. I was a fool for thinking regular case was it.
