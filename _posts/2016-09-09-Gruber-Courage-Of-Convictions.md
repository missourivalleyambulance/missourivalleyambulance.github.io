[John Gruber on the headphone jack:](http://daringfireball.net/2016/09/courage)

> Apple faced a choice between doing something that they knew would be controversial, that they knew would generate [genuine outrage](http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/21/11991302/iphone-no-headphone-jack-user-hostile-stupid), but which would lead to everyone having a better experience in the long run (and for early adopters, a better experience as soon as they start using their AirPods) — or, they could have just kept including a fucking headphone jack and no one would have raised an eyebrow, at the expense of a slower adoption rate of wireless headphones.

Apple have done this time and time again. Floppy drive. Flash. Macbook. 

Time and time again they have brought the industry forward. 

> Few companies other than Apple make decisions that they _know_ will provoke outrage just because they think it’s the right thing to do.

Apple if anything are a company about convictions. Continually they make decisions on our behalf about what technology ought to be. Apple's product decisions are patient and deliberate. Often they will hang back and see how the industry plays something put before they make their move, but when they see an area for genuine improvement they will push the technological envelope. 

Removing the headphone jack was the right call. Wireless is the future. In a few years we'll finally see the headphone jack for how archaic it is. 

> We, as a species, are hooked up to focus on the wshort run, and we’re hooked up to seek popularity and avoid criticism. Choosing to do what you _know_ will be unpopular in the short run but you _believe_ will prove correct in the long run takes courage. Courage of one’s convictions, not courage _running into a burning building to save a life_, but courage nonetheless.
