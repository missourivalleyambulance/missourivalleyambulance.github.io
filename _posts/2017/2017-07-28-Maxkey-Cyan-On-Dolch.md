I’ve been very excited to receive this set. e

[Cyan on Dolch](https://www.old.keyclack.com/product/group-buy-maxkey-sa/) is a [SA profile](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Signature_Plastics_SA_family) keycap set from Maxkey SA; from a group by on [KeyClack](https://www.keyclack.com/). Unlike the [Elvish SA](({{ site.baseurl }}/keyboards/2017-03-29-The-Amazing-Chocolatier)) set I received a few weeks ago, Cyan on Dolch is a fully sculpted SA profile set.

The keys in this set are exceptional, I dare say even superior to offerings from [Signature Plastics](https://pimpmykeyboard.com/). Maxkeys sets are also significantly cheaper than Signature Plastics, this set was only ~$90 compared to the typical ~$150 one pays for an SA profile keycap set.

Keys are thick double shot ABS, and unlike Signature Plastics keys, have a matte finish. Typing on these keys feels fantastic. Being matte, they are slightly less grippy than Signature Plastics’ SA, but the texture is great. The matte finish is fine, not rough at all.

Key fit was great as well. The stems are uniform and very well molded. They’re slightly less tight than Signature Plastics, but not too loose. These keys are well suited for folks who like to swap keys frequently.

At the moment I’ve got these on my [Satan GH60](({{ site.baseurl }}/keyboards/2016-04-19-Satan-GH60-Build-Log)) board, but I eventually plan for them to have a permanent home on my [Red Scarf II + Ver. D.](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/red-scarf-ii-plus-ver-d-custom-mechanical-keyboard-kit?mode=guest_open)
