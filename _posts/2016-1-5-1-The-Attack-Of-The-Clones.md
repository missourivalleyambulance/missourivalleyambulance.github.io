Every year at [CES](http://www.engadget.com/tag/CES/) we see various OEMs debut this year's clones of what Apple did last year. Products that they weren't original enough to think of themselves. Hell, they don't just copy the general look, they copy the **colors** too. 

What's being cloned this year? The Macbook.

The [photocopier](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-2C2gb6ws8&t=0m32s) market must be strong.

OEMs, please start coming up with original ideas. Believe you me, there are folks out there [capable](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/devices/surface-book).
