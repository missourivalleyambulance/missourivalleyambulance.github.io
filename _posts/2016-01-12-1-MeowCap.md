I received my [KeyKollectiv](http://keykollectiv.com/) MeowCap a few days ago. It's not my first artisan keycap, but it is the first one I've _purchased_. I'm such a cat lover that I couldn't NOT buy it. 

I'm quite happy with my decision, the keycap is ADORABLE! It's certainly not the most detailed artisan ever, but I don't typically go for the over-sculpted, way out there keycaps anyway. It's got the perfect amount of detail, and the pink in the paw pads just pops. I think its permanent place will be somewhere on a dark board just to give the board some color and eye-draw. 

The cap is thick and well molded, but I did experience some issues with how tight the MX mount is. Right away when putting on a board part of the mount broke off. I can certainly live with it, but I hope no other part of it breaks.
